Make sure you are staying cool enough too! Watermelon is superb after a workout in the GA summer heat."
2023-03-26 04:36:02+00:00,majombaszo,"Aww!! Thanks!! I'm really proud of me too!

I'm very lucky to be able to say that cost isn't a barrier for me. Certainly not when weighed with the alternative. Thank the Mister for me."
2023-03-26 04:30:24+00:00,MrsBonsai171,"Mr. Bonsai is an avid cyclist and he recommends a company called Gore that makes a clothing line called shake dry. It's really expensive but if you think of it as a further investment in your health it would probably be worth it to you. Keep it up,.proud of you!"
2023-03-26 04:26:27+00:00,HotRailsDev,"I usually rock swim shorts and flip-flops if I'm going to ride my bike in the rain. Rain gear either doesn't work, or I pour sweat like a sauna underneath it.  So, I just accept the rain and pack a weatherproof bag with a towel, clothes, and deodorant."

2023-03-26 04:17:21+00:00,DonnieOfCheektowaga,I’m hoping you can see by the response to your comment and to mine that there is opportunity for you to change your mindset and move towards and a compassionate approach instead of the stigmatizing nonsense you’ve stated. I’d like to have a friendly conversation with you about ways you can make a positive impact and hopefully we can get on the same page.
2023-03-26 04:09:34+00:00,gagilo,Don't offer for free. If you're good make money off it.
2023-03-26 04:08:18+00:00,majombaszo,"Yeah, I'm thinking (and just ordered) some quick dry, ""water resistant"" shorts and a quick dry t shirt designed for surfing to see how those will work. The very lightweight waterproof top I have - one of those basic Columbia pullovers - made me wetter with sweat than if I hadn't been wearing it at all."

2023-03-26 03:47:12+00:00,RockerRebecca24,You’re welcome! Good luck on your journey!
2023-03-26 03:42:33+00:00,GeorgiaYankee73,I heartily second this.  It’s fantastic.
2023-03-26 03:41:22+00:00,majombaszo,Thank you for this link. I'll have to test out the possibilities of waterproofing various items of regular clothing.

2023-03-26 03:21:52+00:00,w_a_w,Looks exactly like Nickajack Creek in Mableton. Not surprising I suppose.
2023-03-26 03:20:57+00:00,RockerRebecca24,"Waterproofing spray for clothing is wonderful! Here’s a great article on it: https://www.tripsavvy.com/best-waterproofing-sprays-4773587

When my brother lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana while going to LSU, he swore by waterproofing his shoes and clothes."
2023-03-26 03:20:16+00:00,theworsthammer,My grandparents in Vienna always had the short cokes in the pantry fridge and peanuts on the coffee table.
2023-03-26 03:10:11+00:00,RearEchelon,"Also born &amp; raised in GA and I never got it, either. I prefer my peanuts boiled anyway"
2023-03-26 03:03:24+00:00,MrsWhorehouse,This is the way.
2023-03-26 02:59:29+00:00,MrsWhorehouse,"That girl’s so bucktoothed she can eat the peanuts out of a Dr. Pepper bottle… or coke bottle as the case may be.  Old, old country bullshit right there."
2023-03-26 02:57:58+00:00,majombaszo,"I have thought long and hard about what sub to post this in in order to get the best suggestions. I decided on this sub because you are my people and need no further clarification on what I mean and won't think I'm exaggerating.

After getting over some lengthy injuries and mental health issues, I've dedicated myself to fixing my health and I'm already healthier than I've been in many years.

Part of this journey is getting out and walking at a fast pace for at least two miles a day (I'm working up to five minimum). I haven't missed a day in exactly one month today but I'm coming up on a weather problem.

I don't mind going out in the rain but I do not want to get soaked through from the rain. I am looking for something that's waterproof or resistant that won't end up making me physically wetter than I would be if I just went out in a t shirt. 

What do all y'all outdoor physically active people wear to keep the rain off that won't cook you because it's a thousand degrees out? I lived in the Pacific Northwest for many years so I have rain gear but even the lightest jacket I have, while keeping me dry from the rain, makes me feel as if I'm dissolving and I end up smelling like a wet goat. 

Any and all suggestions (other than an umbrella) are appreciated. 

Thanks!"
2023-03-26 02:54:55+00:00,88secret,I pass Douceur de France on the way to my cousin’s house every few months and I’ve always wondered about it.  Thanks for the rec!

2023-03-26 02:46:42+00:00,Low_Sherbert_9064,I’ve heard this word and said it in my own vocabulary my whole life that it’s just not something you think too hard about but it’s so funny to see it spelt out for some reason and I’ve never seen it done lol
2023-03-26 02:45:01+00:00,eastcoastian,The Suwanee Greenway is an amazing local treasure. I ride it often and really look forward to their future plans of expansion.

2023-03-26 02:27:22+00:00,Luis-Elias,Sweetwater the coffee shop in sautee?
2023-03-26 02:14:56+00:00,ZakP808,"In Marietta: Douceur De France excellent breakfast and French pastries.

2023-03-26 01:38:04+00:00,heartbrokenandgone,I suppose doing this with diet coke will not suffice? Sounds extremely good rn
2023-03-26 01:21:14+00:00,Turbulent_Gur_8692,Moved to Georgia last year from Colorado and saw a few of my coworkers doing this. I had never heard of it. I gave it a try and didn’t see the appeal. I would prefer to enjoy them separately. But it certainly wasn’t gross like I expected.
