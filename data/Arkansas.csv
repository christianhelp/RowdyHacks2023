I literally never have and never will vote for either party.  There is no party line to buy into.  Respecting ones right to transition while recognizing that they are still a biological male or female...isn't hateful.  No amount of hormones is going to change chromosomes.  

The problem comes when one side, who champions science, willfully chooses to ignore it when the other side actually has a point.  The problem comes when biological males who have transitioned destroy biological females in sports...and so called 'feminists' are okay with that.  

Biological women are literally losing championships and scholarships because trans-women, with a natural advantage, are blowing them out of the water.  ""But they're women too,"" apparently.  

It's the willful avoidance of basic common sense that makes what was once a centrist look like a nazi to the left.  Sorry, but that's not my problem.      

&gt;(Also, you can swear on reddit, it's okay.)

I've had comments blocked because of that in the past, so I just don't chance it anymore."

2023-03-26 04:29:03+00:00,ekienhol,"Somalia was supplied because of the meme in the original post, which by the way we are beginning to look like because of the child labor decisions made by this legislature and governor."
2023-03-26 04:26:54+00:00,frank_white414,"If that‚Äôs your criteria then I suppose your point is technically right, but you could apply that to a ton of other countries than Somalia, many of whom are much better off. Choosing one of the objectively poorest and hellish countries on earth (partly by way of US policy) to compare Arkansas to is a bit too hyperbolic in my opinion."

2023-03-26 03:58:04+00:00,Treozukik,"What power exactly do you think children have to stand up to their parents' wills? The government no longer has to grant permission to a child in order for them to work in Arkansas, making it much easier for parents to force their child into working. Corporations like Tyson are going to have a field day with this legislation. Children aren't able to negotiate for themselves, not because they are legally prevented from doing so but because they are children, their brains are not developed, its the same reason we don't let 14 yo's consent to sex. Adults walk into exploitive labor contracts all the time, the children are going to be much worse off a this, which is exactly why this legislation was passed; too many adults were fed up with not being paid what they are deserved and quit, so we're going to replace them with literal children."
2023-03-26 03:57:20+00:00,frank_white414,"My point has been clear this entire time: the OP meme draws an absurd comparison. I‚Äôve yet to see any legitimate argument come out of you otherwise.

How is my point hyperbole but OP is not?"

2023-03-26 03:45:07+00:00,Bpefiz,"&gt;	What exactly do you mean by exploitation? Give an example.

Well, specifically, keeping the cost of goods, services, and housing high, while keeping wages low, keeping people in a desperate cycle of poverty where they‚Äôre forced to put their children to work for shitty wages, potentially in dangerous jobs just so their family can afford basic necessities required for human life in this world.

I guess that kind of exploitation is what we‚Äôre worried about? If ‚Äúit‚Äôs not literally slavery‚Äù is your starting point‚Ä¶ Jesus Christ can‚Äôt even help you‚Ä¶"

2023-03-26 03:32:45+00:00,elliotb1989,"Yes, that is correct. You know they get to choose if they want to work or not, right? We aren‚Äôt talking slavery here. What exactly do you mean by exploitation? Give an example."

2023-03-26 03:11:10+00:00,SneakySnakies,"So, by saying ‚Äúbe like Jesus‚Äù, do you mean killing a child for drawing your visage? Or sending bears to kill folks? Or supporting slavery? 

Or is that you‚Äôre lying to yourself? Are you ignorant of history, or are you choosing not to understand what your religion does? 

Modern Christian ‚Äúmorals‚Äù are socially regressive and a cancer to human rights. There is no good Christian when Christianity is based on mindless adherence to Christ, who is/has been being used as a tool to fulfill fascistic political agendas."

Secondly they weren‚Äôt in trouble for underage kids, they were in trouble for underage kids in unsafe conditions. That‚Äôs still illegal.
