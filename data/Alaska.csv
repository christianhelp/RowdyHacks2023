2023-03-26 06:25:33+00:00,MrCuzz,The US military has tried to find appropriate replacements for bunny boots multiple times but keeps coming back to the same design. They work.
2023-03-26 06:24:30+00:00,hellraisinhardass,"I respectfully disagree on the Keens based on my experience-   I love Keen hiking boots, they are my summer hiking boots.  Their winter boots are poorly insulated and the soles get so frozen they break (and are *very* slick).  I should mention that I'm referring to their safety toe boots about 8-5 years ago.  Maybe their other/newer lines are better.  But every person I know that tried the winter Keen boots ended up with split soles, they literally snap in halfway if you squat down in them when it's colder than about 0F."
2023-03-26 06:24:18+00:00,MrCuzz,Black bunny boots; the ones only rated to -20F. When I do the driveway my feet are the warmest part of my body and dry at the same time.
2023-03-26 06:24:15+00:00,PlaysWithTren,"""The communities of Juneau, Sitka, downtown and midtown Anchorage, the areas surrounding the college/University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester and the ""Alaska Bush"" – rural, sparsely populated Alaska – stand out as Democratic strongholds, while the Kenai Peninsula, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, parts of Anchorage, and Fairbanks (including North Pole and Eielson Air Force Base), Ketchikan, Wrangell, and Petersburg serve as the Republican Party electoral base. Over half of all registered voters have chosen ""Non-Partisan"" or ""Undeclared"" as their affiliation,\[5\] the only state where that is the case.""  


Relevant Wiki Quote.  Interesting they called out Ketchikan/Wrangell/Petersburg as ketchikan is relevant, petersburg and wrangell are irrelevant versus bethel nome barrow ETC."
2023-03-26 06:18:25+00:00,PlaysWithTren,"Are there any resources that explain or expand upon why Southeast Alaska is known as being the progressive region of the State?  I am from Juneau so I have my thoughts/beliefs, but was interested to know if there's been any research.  I grew up in the region so I can make an essay on my beliefs but I felt it was best to learn if there's better information.  


If there is research/articles that cover the whole state, I'd be happy to see that as well.   Thank you"

VERMONT, EH? DO YOUR CARS RUN ON MAPLE SYRUP?

OHHH NEW MEXICO? HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE BREAKING BAD HOUSE? DO THEY REALLY CHASE YOU OFF WITH ASSAULT RIFLES IF YOU THROW PIZZA ON THEIR ROOF?

2023-03-26 03:41:13+00:00,Existing_Departure82,Not a great place to keep them for any reason whatsoever.   Are you a resident of AK looking for something close?  You can pop down to Seattle and check out Woodland Park Zoo.

2023-03-26 03:35:37+00:00,ChickenMindReader,"Second the Lacrosse. I’ve worn the absolute shit out of these boots and they keep giving. Yes the are spendy. But I’ve gotten every dollar back plus some. Even fell in a river and had to run 2 miles out in them full of water. They kept me warm, and I survived. Cannot speak highly enough."
2023-03-26 03:33:17+00:00,Comfortable-Taro-912,"Get some NEOs. Overboots you can wear with any kind of shoe or boot underneath. Warm and incredibly light. They also have removable studs you can adjust or take off if you don’t need them, plus a built in gaiter for deep snow. I would wear these with a pair of crocs and be completely fine. The velcro doesn’t hold up long but I brought it to a upholstery place and had them add a second buckle. Last and most important is they take seconds to put on and take off. Good luck!"

2023-03-26 03:05:27+00:00,Blue05D,Insulated gortex Danners do me well. Pair with some genuine wool/blend socks and you're good. Have a similar pair of Timberlands that are less Insulated when I'm not spending hours outside. Socks matter just as much as the boot.

2023-03-26 02:53:51+00:00,Itsover9000-,I really like the animals and was wondering where the cheapest place is to see them. Anyone know of monkeys in alaska ?
2023-03-26 02:49:37+00:00,JonnyDoeDoe,The Baffin Snow Monster is excellent if you're going to be out all day in the interior... But I use my Baffin Crossfire boots as my go-to cold weather boot...
