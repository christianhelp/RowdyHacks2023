2023-03-26 04:53:33+00:00,frenchbulldogmom2018,Yesterday I was forced to turn around n the air. It was 85â€¢ in my house.
2023-03-26 04:47:28+00:00,Toezap,I did research hours for credit with Dr. Yates on phonological neighbors. Basically just explained the little computer test students were going to take and debriefed them afterward. I don't remember exactly how it worked but they had to push a button if the word on the screen meet some criteria and the experiment was looking at response time.
2023-03-26 04:25:38+00:00,USCGMedic,Underrated response
2023-03-26 04:19:50+00:00,habitualnegatory,The lady that does our taxes efiledâ€¦.got the direct deposit around 10 days later.  Much faster than I expected.
2023-03-26 03:19:54+00:00,CanICanTheCanCan,I caved this Monday. Though I hear we've got a second cold front headed our way so we'll see how long it lasts
2023-03-26 03:09:13+00:00,kessykris,Moved from Minnesota to Alabama about four years ago. I get this so much! Thatâ€™s exactly what we did.
2023-03-26 02:46:20+00:00,IMSITTINGINYOURCHAIR,"auto thermostat, 68 heat and 75 ac unless I override it. been opening windows and changing it to 81 on ac. if I hear it kick on I just close the windows and cancel the hold."
2023-03-26 02:45:48+00:00,JazzRider,"Walked in,the house was 80 degrees. On it went!"

2023-03-26 02:37:12+00:00,Drewt00,"Yeah same here. Dothan area. Got those windows opened up before noon - keep the blinds closed on the sun side... takes work! 

Got up to 84 and it almost broke me, but I decided to just embrace it and do a bunch of yard work lol. 

It's back down to 82 already and I'm feeling smug."
2023-03-26 02:34:07+00:00,Drewt00,"Ha! Dothan area reporting in - did not cave. Really wanted to, but the power man can suck my sweaty balls."
2023-03-26 02:16:29+00:00,photogypsy,I had to write 40 pages on it for English in high school (we were assigned books). Itâ€™s such a hard book to research that my history teacher let me turn it in for her class too.
2023-03-26 02:15:01+00:00,werdmouf,I use my AC all the time. You don't?
2023-03-26 01:37:10+00:00,inkah50,"A lot, but pets and kids bring it in as well"
2023-03-26 01:35:26+00:00,inkah50,"I actually did grow up without A/C but in the midwest.

Transplant here 10 years ago, but lifetime habits die hard. Up there, we didnt turn the air on until it was going to continuosly be on, same for the heat. So we suffered til mid May  (on for the rest of summer) and froze til Nov to turn on the heat forvwinter. Never ever ever in the same month would we have used heat and air, we just suffered. Guess we were cheap â€¦..thats just how things were done"

2023-03-26 01:07:05+00:00,MyGFisSexyAF,"I like it to be 64 at night in my room. And my cat already tore all my window screens so I canâ€™t open the windows. So, this ship sailed a while ago."
2023-03-26 01:01:21+00:00,youknowwhotheyare,My car temp said 96. I was in a sweat walking through Loweâ€™s.

2023-03-26 00:36:20+00:00,RTR7105,"Yep, I have had several I've liked but nothing that hits like a Steel City Watermelon Pop."
2023-03-26 00:33:22+00:00,NavierIsStoked,How much tree pollen is in your house?
2023-03-26 00:32:36+00:00,bhamsportsfan96,"Sunrise Donuts is also excellent, but theyâ€™re only open 5 AM to 1 PM. For a town its size, we really are blessed (I know I have a Perry County flair, but I moved from there to Shelby County)."

2023-03-26 00:25:19+00:00,TrustLeft,u/inkah50 you ain't one of those that grew up poor with no AC and now you call those with AC weak are you?
2023-03-26 00:21:20+00:00,TrustLeft,"me, turn to cool off then back off. Humidity kills me, not heat."
2023-03-26 00:14:43+00:00,homonculus_prime,"So, you're saying they were justified traitors...  Got it!"
2023-03-26 00:14:41+00:00,jefuf,"My AC runs whenever it has to to keep the indoor humidity to 50%. To the extent it can. December, June, whenever."
2023-03-26 00:09:29+00:00,lilvon,Yall have A/C?
2023-03-26 00:09:20+00:00,bosshawk1,"The World Games wasn't more successful because it was run by incompetent utility company execs who had no business being near the games. Add in that the ""500,000"" number, which was a fake and inflated number, kept getting thrown out, and it actually kept people away. People thought there would be chaos. Why would there be? No one was going to have a car."
2023-03-26 00:00:56+00:00,RTR7105,Really miss good popsicles since both Steel City essentially went under and Frios sold out.
2023-03-25 23:58:26+00:00,KittenVicious,"ðŸ«£ðŸ™‹

It was 80Â° upstairs and 76Â° downstairs, so I kicked both units to cool to 75Â° this afternoon"
2023-03-25 23:53:21+00:00,HealthyBox5,"A bit further south than you, mine has been on since early Feb."
2023-03-25 23:52:08+00:00,CutThroatRob,Nope. Ceiling fans and window fans only. Hoping to go another month without using AC.
2023-03-25 23:40:09+00:00,Redn3ckJ0k3r,What we're going to have to agree to disagree I do not see the battle flag of the army of Northern Virginia as a racist symbol and I never will.
2023-03-25 23:38:54+00:00,coconutsups,"Not sure why you are bringing up Lee. While I am aware of his views regarding slavery it does not take away from the fact he fought for a war that was all about it. The articles of secession are very clear. https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/secession-the-confederate-flag-and-slavery#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20found%20in,white%20supremacy%20in%20the%20South."
