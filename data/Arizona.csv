People who grow crops in Yuma, people who live in Lake Havasu City, Mexico, etc"
2023-03-26 06:07:26+00:00,whatkylewhat,I dig the old cabins more.
2023-03-26 06:04:05+00:00,bigboyz75,Point four is very interesting.  Any insight on who the stakeholders are?
2023-03-26 06:02:35+00:00,fingnumb,Whatever this is... It's stupid.
2023-03-26 05:54:17+00:00,No_Bus_5060,PM me coordinates?
2023-03-26 05:37:44+00:00,Common_Appearance,"1. I kinda go back and forth
2. No idea
3. In reality there is no correlation. But, if you walk into a Mexican restaurant and hear most, if not all people, speaking Spanish - you're in for a treat.
4. No. Dry heat is entirely better. It sucks, but I'll take an Arizona summer over a Florida summer any day.
5. Everyone either loves or hates Tucson. I think the roads kinda suck, but then I haven't been there in years."
2023-03-26 05:30:38+00:00,BeKind_BeTheChange,Nemesis. And greatest attraction.
2023-03-26 05:24:09+00:00,Objective_Ebb6898,"1.Presskit. 2. The Sun Devils made them do it. 3. No, run. 4. No it‚Äôs actually a dry heat extremely low humidity which makes your sweat evaporate super fast.  You can die in twenty minutes in this desert so you have to learn to hydrate constantly. 5. Yes. Not only the condition, but the layout. Traffic flow is stupid bad."
2023-03-26 05:21:38+00:00,pluvoaz,"I know you're being sarcastic, but at work I have a fantastic view of Tempe Town Lake and I have seen seagulls there. I was sure I was mistaken, but there are local bird watching sites that back me up. I saw a bald eagle there last month. I even saw a pelican once. Trippy."
2023-03-26 05:18:37+00:00,Luke-Skystalker,Just moved here a few months ago from Louisiana. This is good to hear

2023-03-26 04:46:32+00:00,goodvibes_onethree,Spent a little over a week traveling through FL to AL then to LA in June. I've lived here all my life and never again will I visit the south in summer. Absolutely beautiful place though!
2023-03-26 04:40:56+00:00,BackcountryAZ,"I came across this a year or so ago and spent more time than I should of trying to figure out the joke. I seem to remember figuring out the origin, but I also seem to remember being underwhelmed by the answer. But maybe I was drunk‚Ä¶who knows"
2023-03-26 04:37:57+00:00,jmoriarty,Check out /u/ajamesmccarthy for more info on how he did it and other incredible work of his.

2023-03-26 04:24:47+00:00,whatkylewhat,Those are not state campgrounds.
2023-03-26 04:09:36+00:00,whiterabbit818,"Presskit like biscuit with a P.  It was very unsettling when I learned that. 

It‚Äôs definitely a Dry heat but it‚Äôs a different,  unbearable heat than humid-heat. You‚Äôll see soon enough!"
2023-03-26 04:08:48+00:00,geeamouse,"LOL a long while. The mall was put in quite some time back. I‚Äôm sure you probably will be surprised at the changes. It changed quite a bit from our first assignment (2002) until we came back in 2017. The post has changed too! All the housing is different there. And the shopping in town is quite a bit different.  If you visit, have a great time!"
2023-03-26 03:56:34+00:00,shhmosby,Tucson roads are 100% as shitty as everyone says.
2023-03-26 03:48:32+00:00,Imaginary_R3ality,Mall?! Hmmm... I guess it's been a while. Maybe time to take a trip down the Fort Huachaca and poke around SV. Hopefully it has improved a bit because it sure is beautiful around there. I spent most of my time on base or in Car Canyon.
2023-03-26 03:45:37+00:00,welldamnitjerry,"hey! thank you so much, this helps!!"
2023-03-26 03:45:23+00:00,EngineeringOld1402,"Thanks for the votes, I'm getting up
there in age. Golly, Wonder what next
50 years will bring to Phoenix. When I 
arrived back then the ole saying was
""Phoenix is behind the times,  like 20 years."
2023-03-26 03:43:25+00:00,TechnoTrain,Hey friend. Are you using this site? I'm seeing availability in June. https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/234287
2023-03-26 03:42:11+00:00,Main_Force_Patrol,"Nice find, I‚Äôve only seen Bald Eagles near Saguaro Lake."
2023-03-26 03:36:37+00:00,BunnyArcade,"#1 it's pronounced Presskit, all locals will badmouth you if you say otherwise. 
#2 you can find it on their website, I believe a user already explained it pretty well. 
#3 just because it's not as clean doesn't mean it's not as good. It's sometimes even better.
#4 I believe dry heat sucks, and we are tired of going into cars and getting third degree burns on the seatbelt and steering wheel, but it is a lot more comfortable than a humid heat. 
#5 the tuscon roads are just super old(ish) and they're worn. If you have an alignment issue, I'd say watch out. But as long as you're going the AZ speed limit of 10-15 over the established speed or the regular speed limit, you should be fine."
2023-03-26 03:33:48+00:00,Madreese,"That's still Phoenix. I'm really talking about the Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler areas. The streets are well-maintained in these cities. But I'm not going to quibble. They are all better than Tucson. ;) And I don't know why."
2023-03-26 03:29:07+00:00,welldamnitjerry,"thats basically it, i was searching for tent campgrounds in oak creek canyon or mount lemmon for early june and all of the locations are saying closed‚Ä¶ any advice?"
2023-03-26 03:27:28+00:00,TechnoTrain,"1. Arizona has received a lot of moisture, but that's not really where Lake Mead gets its water from. Keep in mind most of Arizona is south of Lake Mead, so most of the water in Arizona flows downhill to the Pacific without touching Mead. 

2. The majority of the Colorado River basin has remained relatively dry; at least dry enough that Mead isn't acting like Roosevelt or other lakes in the state.

3. The reservoirs on the Colorado River system are quite vast. Other reservoirs may see significant fills while Mead, being low in that chain, may see hardly any gain. 

4. Although low, Mead is actually not the last stop on the Colorado River. Hydrologists have to make a choice to keep Lake Havasu and other reservoirs at certain levels as well. The reasons behind what gets raised and what gets lowered are complex with many stakeholders.

I've seen this question come up before so thought I'd try my best to outline just a few of the reasons Mead isn't acting like other reservoirs in the state."
2023-03-26 03:26:44+00:00,Desert_Beach,"1. Ott.
2. Stay away from Tucson at all costs.
3. Yes.
4. You will to survive will be tested before the end of August.
5. See answer to #2."

2023-03-26 03:04:06+00:00,Significant-Foot1908,Beautiful. I saw one on the 101 ramp one time and I‚Äôll never forget it. Thanks for sharing.
2023-03-26 03:02:56+00:00,blznburro,"1: Both. Anyone not from Prescott says Pres-cott and people from there say the other.
2: Because they‚Äôre backwards down there. (Real answer from u/GandalfTheSilverFox
3: Plenty of good ones with A ratings. My favorite has a B rating. Who knows. 
4: I can fly from Phoenix to Georgia in June and I am much hotter in Georgia.
5: Yes. Also it smells like pee. The whole place."
