2023-03-26 02:47:41+00:00,Darby_Bagwell,"A number of years ago I was in Pittsburgh visiting family.  I was on the south side driving opposite the traffic.  It was around 5 pm and all the traffic was exiting downtown, across the bridge and on the ramp to the freeway heading to the South Hills suburbs.  I was driving opposite traffic.  Everyone was leaving downtown, I was heading to downtown.  

In the center of this major intersection was an elevated concrete island with an awning protecting from rain, snow and sun.  A lone police officer sat in this island manually operating the traffic lights for this major intersection.  

I was the only car approaching the red light.  The cars exiting town, coming across the bridge had the green light.  I sat at that red light for 14 minutes. (And it was red when I got there.)  The officer controlling the traffic lights saw me at the red light and gave the traffic coming over the bridge, exiting downtown, the green light. 

When you sit at a red light for 14 minutes you go through the emotional spectrum similar to the stages of grief.  First is not much of anything, then annoyance, frustration, then irritation, anger, outrage, giddiness, laughter, finally acceptance actually rooting to see how much longer you can sit at the red light.  

By the time I got the green light there were probably 50 cars waiting behind me. As I was crossing the bridge heading into town I saw the cars leaving town already had the green light and all these people who were pau work were once again on their way.

As I watched downtown Pittsburgh empty out I had an epiphany.  The police officer left me at a red light while he let probably more than a thousand cars get on their way.   I understood why the traffic flowed so well.

I will contrast this with Honolulu.  Several years ago the city was digging up Liliha Street in front of Mayor Wrights Housing.  Cars were backed up from Vineyard Blvd. down Liliha Street, across King Street, down Dillingham Blvd all the way past where the Sizzler used to be. (Somewhere around where the Popeyes is now).   My wife works in the area and I was frequently caught in this traffic.  

Excruciatingly slow traffic would crawl along Dillingham Blvd.from Kalihi Street crossing King Street, along Liliha Street passing Mayor Wright‚Äôs housing, continuing Mauka, finally reaching Vineyard Blvd and then it was wide open to travel in any direction.  

As you drove past Mayor Wright‚Äôs there was an HPD officer guarding the hole that was being dug in the street.  Traffic funneled down to one lane.   I give the officer credit.  That hole in the street was never stolen.  

As you approached Vineyard Blvd. only five to eight cars we‚Äôre getting through the green light.  This mess was going on every day for months.  

I was stopped in traffic one day right next to the police officer who was guarding the hole.  I opened my window and I asked him:

 ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you walk up to the corner, open that metal box, flip the switch and give us the green light?  Let a hundred cars through, clear out some of this crazy backlog.  There is very light traffic on Vineyard.  Give Vineyard the red light and clear out Liliha Street / Dillingham.  Or at least leave the light green long enough to clear 25 or 50 cars.  As it is now only 5 or 8 cars only are getting through each green light.‚Äù  

Traffic on Vineyard was very light compared to the log jam we were in.  

The officer explained to me:

If he left the hole unguarded 

1) someone might steal it. /s

2) Honolulu does not have the ability to manually operate traffic lights.

He stated Honolulu traffic lights have only three options:

1) They could be left on automatic (which they are 99.8% of the time).

2) They could be set to blink yellow.

3) They could be set to blink red. 

We do not have the capability of someone manually controlling the traffic lights.

He told me the only way to accomplish what I was asking for was to have police officers physically work the intersection, and with an intersection as big as Liliha and Vineyard that would take a minimum of three police officers, maybe four. 

And so we suffered on for another month or two until the hole was filled and the other lanes were re-opened. 

One more example:  

Again several years ago road work was being done on H1 East viaduct by the airport.  Every Saturday I would drive my wife to work and I would take that route (force of habit).

About a quarter mile after the Red Hill cut off a sign was placed reading ‚Äúroad work ahead‚Äù.   By the time you read the sign letting you know road work was going on you already passed the alternate cut off you could‚Äôve taken. There was nothing you could do at this point unless you went Nimitz.  It was too late for Moanalua / Red Hill, you already passed it.  By the time I would get through the congested slow down and got my wife to work I would put it out of my mind until the following Saturday when I saw the sign again.  

Honolulu is regularly crowned as the worst traffic in the country.   I understand some limitations because of our unique situation but I also think we regularly shoot ourselves in the foot.  There has to be some bright people around who can implement small common sense changes to improve the traffic problem."
