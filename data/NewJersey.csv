Keep your stores and your progress out of here!"" And I'm like, bitch you live like an hour from NYC. If you'd like to live in the country, go to like, Nebraska or Alabama, and let the rest of us have a good grocery store or a decent restaurant within  like 20 minutes."

2023-03-23 14:07:47+00:00,ben1204,Itâ€™s a sign of endearment. My best friend and I call each other a dumb bitch. Tried explaining this once to europeans who didnâ€™t get it.

2023-03-23 13:20:42+00:00,emailusernamepasswrd,"The fact that most obgyn practices (and insurance companies) don't offer confirmation ultrasounds when you go in for an initial visit due to a positive pregnancy test is mind boggling to me. Just because ectopic pregnancies are considered ""rare"" (which imo they're not as rare as people make it out to be because myself included I've known at least 5 women who have had at least one, one woman I knew had 2 and lost both her tubes because of it) doesn't mean you don't check. First time I was pregnant they did a confirmation ultrasound, wound up miscarrying but at least i knew it wasnt an ectopic. That was the only dr who did it without me having to more or less go Karen on them to be taken seriously.

 I've had to do everything from bitch out staff/make a scene demanding my medical records to switch practices, to having my husband who is THE SAME AGE AS I AM call and berate staff/doctors so I could be taken seriously. I am 33 years old now, and I *still* need my husband to step in sometimes to say the exact fucking same goddamn thing I've been saying repeatedly to be taken seriously. It's absolutely infuriating, especially because prior to all these fertility issues **I was a nurse**! Like not only am I well in tune with my body but I've had legitimate medical training, and I still am not taken seriously!"

2023-03-23 00:00:53+00:00,emailusernamepasswrd,"I had gotten pregnant and was told I had a chemical miscarriage. Like a week goes by and I know something is off because I have a ton of pain in my abdomen. I call the dr office they tell me come in for an ultrasound and they don't see anything besides a cyst on my ovary and tell me it's fine. I call a few days later I'm like I'm in a lot of pain there's no way this is normal, they tell me it is and wait a month before coming back in. Few more days go by and the pain is just ridiculous and I call and bitch them out more or less and they schedule me to come in for another ultrasound. Then they see the cyst over doubled in size in under a week and schedule me for surgery the following Monday. Well turns out these morons missed an ectopic pregnancy in my fallopian tube TWO TIMES and it ruptured. It was about the size of a 6ish week embryo and I was bleeding internally. They had to take a chunk of my ovary and my entire fallopian tube out. If I hadn't kept calling and complaining I probably would have bled to death. 

I used to live on a military base years ago, and the hospital was (probably still is) notorious for horrific medicine (they had to shut down their entire labor and delivery floor for a while after 5 newborns died suddenly). This woman's husband was overseas but she had already been scheduled for getting her tubes tied and figured it's a fairly simple procedure so it wouldn't be an issue. Gets the procedure done and goes to the ER a week ish later complaining of pain/nausea/etc. they tell her nothing we can do go home. She went home and wound up bleeding to death on her bathroom floor and her 9 year old found her. 

I've had both male and female doctors make me seem like I'm crazy/irrational when I actually had something seriously wrong with me idk how many times now. It's insane what women experience in a medical setting still after all this time."
