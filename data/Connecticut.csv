Well no, he..

&amp;#x200B;

Well, not exactly, he..

&amp;#x200B;

""Did he help the homeless?""

&amp;#x200B;

No, not that.

Middletown, however, is a more happening city to live than Hartford if you’re a young professional. Wesleyan adds a fun flair to the area, there’s some great restaurants and artsy events. It has a more distinct cultural identity than hartfords insurance life."

2023-03-26 04:25:10+00:00,StackCheddar12,"""Tax payers in Greenwich are still paying much more in taxes per person (vs Bridgeport residents)"" a better way and more direct way to look at this is someone in Greenwich with a 1 million dollar home is paying roughly $7,700 a year in real estate taxes and some in Bridgeport with a $350k home is paying over $10k. And when you compare the per capita incomes of both places, Bridgeport is paying some of the highest taxes in the nation on a per capita basis! So it's not necessarily true that Greenwich residents pay much more in taxes unless they have really expensive homes!"
2023-03-26 04:25:04+00:00,RebornPastafarian,That’s really going to hurt their yearly bonuses.

2023-03-26 04:18:57+00:00,lunkercat,I don’t know what the acceptable amount of time is before I speak to my dad but I’m going to err on the side of caution with this
2023-03-26 04:17:04+00:00,Correct-Potential25,Yes the huskies were dominant in the 1900’s just like the 2000’s
2023-03-26 04:14:12+00:00,Shortchange96,It can be both the decade or the century. What we’re both saying is correct. Not sure how this is a hard concept for you to grasp
2023-03-26 04:10:23+00:00,Correct-Potential25,The 2000’s constitutes 2000-2009. Not sure how this is a hard concept for you to grasp
2023-03-26 04:07:33+00:00,Shortchange96,who said it was? They said the 90’s like those were the glory years when Uconn has won 3 in the 2000’s
2023-03-26 04:05:49+00:00,Formal_Asparagus_987,I have to disagree with you. I think it’s good. There’s been too many pedestrians dying just for walking it’s so sad. I think we need the cameras and speed traps. It will force people to slow down. People are driving in the streets like how they drive on the highways. It’s really sad.
