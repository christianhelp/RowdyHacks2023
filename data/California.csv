2023-03-26 05:50:42+00:00,VAGIMALILTEACUP,Can California construct drains that flow rain water into groundwater aquifers?
2023-03-26 05:44:57+00:00,wienersandwine,This is the real answer
2023-03-26 05:41:38+00:00,neurochild,"Well, partially because that's our new normal every year now; partially because all the fuel that's been building up for decades is still there regardless of the recent rain; and partially because as the commenter above me said, there's a ton of new, highly flammable fuel (grasses and shrubs) sprouting now because they finally have water, which creates potential for a large amount ladder fuels in forests."

2023-03-26 05:11:36+00:00,irishramen,"I think maybe because getting some bad fires this summer means less to burn later, when there may be less water?"

2023-03-26 04:31:14+00:00,Additional_Tell_8645,"“We have to let our rivers flow differently, and let the rivers flood a little more and recharge our groundwater in wet seasons,” Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and co-founder of the Pacific Institute in Oakland, previously told CNN. “Instead of thinking we can control all floods, we have to learn to live with them.”

There’s always someone who knows and tries to tell everyone, but they aren’t listened to. Or if they are heard, they’re forgotten."
2023-03-26 04:24:55+00:00,Iagos_Beard,"John Steinbeck, “East of Eden” on California:

“There would be five or six wet and wonderful years when there might be nineteen to twenty-five inches of rain, and the land would shout with grass. Then would come six or seven pretty good years of twelve to sixteen inches of rain. And then the dry years would come, and sometimes there would be only seven or eight inches of rain. The land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley.""
...
""And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way."""

2023-03-26 03:00:35+00:00,skankenstein,We had the privilege of watching a bald eagle soar back and forth over the mill pond in Graeagle one 4th of July weekend.  It was amazing. The only other bald eagle I’ve ever seen was the injured one they used to bring to the state fair to educate people on wildlife populations.

2023-03-26 01:57:10+00:00,basketballakev,"My CA AGI was about 245k and I paid about 20k in state income taxes. I left primarily due to the cost of affordable housing. Much of my family and friends still live in CA. 

I'm grateful that my parents transferred our family home in LA county to me to take advantage of the prop 58 exclusion so I can hold onto their prop 13 property tax basis even when that home is no longer my primary residence. That's how fuc**d housing is in CA. A lot of my friends in LA county will be inheriting their parents' home and hold on to their prop 13 property tax basis.

For much of the CA coastal cities, unless you're a high income earner or if you're benefiting significantly from generational wealth, it just doesn't make financial sense to stay put."

That bypass that fills it is so poorly designed and managed that it's a wonder any water ever gets into that lake."
