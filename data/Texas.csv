I just don't even know where to begin with this. And what's worse is this person is serious.

Not joking y'all, I think this might be a Branch Davidian. Not gonna guess on their age, but yikes about not even being able to imagine about how people didn't use pay-phones and landlines back then. Shows a lack of TV and movies in their life.

&gt;Why are you so sure the that Rodriquez is even telling the truth?

Because pretty much everybody else still alive has admitted/testified to the exact same story.

&gt;Are you going to pretend that Koresh wasn’t shot himself by the ATF after answering the door?

Where did you possibly get this? I'm dying to see your source, can't wait.

&gt;When your life is threaten you are 100 percent in the right to defend yourself no matter who it is.

Your life isn't threatened by ATF agents serving a search warrant whether they've shot your guard dogs or not. Again, all survivors have told the same story, as soon as Koresh heard agents were coming he hid the women and children and had all the men armed in defensive positions around the compound.

Why would a peaceful Christian ever do such a thing? If he truly had Christ and Christ's love and goodness in his heart and nothing to hide, why not just open his doors in peace with open arms?

Why would he possibly choose armed combat over just surrendering to authorities as Jesus did?

&gt;They had no case so they went looking for a case."

I seriously don't understand how y'all are even thinking otherwise."

I do also wish we could live in a eutopia without fear, war, or wanton violence, but this is the hand we have all been dealt. 

Stay safe out there y'all ❤️"
2023-03-24 20:16:42+00:00,omgpickles63,"How often do you think gender affirming surgery happens for those under 18? It is ridicously hard for adults to get the surgery. It takes years of being on hormones and living as the preferred gender. In 2019-2021, 56 genital surgeries happened for children out of the 80k plus children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I don't know their stories. Neither do you. The desire to detransition is at about 1% from a review of studies. The reasons for detransition is varied including society rejecting them. 

Bar kids from going to Hooters, Twin Peaks, ect and I will believe that y'all care about the children. Don't parents have responsibility for monitoring their kids. I thought people wanted the state to get out of people's lives. Also, a majority of drag shows are just clown shows. You only hear about the ones that cross the lines. These shows should make it known there will be adult themes. However, conflating someone dressing in non gender conforming clothing as adult entertainment is ridiculous.

I end this by asking the original question. As people vocally speak to eliminating transgenderism, why wouldn't any trans person (adult or child) feel threatened by the state and society.

2023-03-24 20:16:02+00:00,SuperJohnBravo,"Kinda interesting, I saw an argument thrown at 2A supporters who claim they're right to guns is based on being able to fight the government that ""what do you think you're gonna do against the military and tanks?"". So I'm just wondering, if there's a government body that controls the military trying to ""eradicate"" you with force, what do you think you're gonna do? All of a sudden now it doesn't seem ""crazy"" to want to exercise your 2A rights, does it? Well come on then, let's get y'all armed up and properly trained. Welcome! Don't care who or what you are, if you're an American sick of government bullshit, you're welcome as far as I'm concerned."

You can provide your own links if you can find any to support your point, but like the other user you probably won't."
2023-03-24 17:58:54+00:00,RosyMemeLord,"Now i know dave chappelle isnt real popular with most trans folks, but i still love how his joke about ""the only way to get everyone serious about gun control is for every african american to register for a firearm"" seems to ring more and more true every day. 

The way i see it, these fuckers are bullies. (Who time and time again don't actually speak for the majority of texans or even really a very very large section). And the only way to deal with a bully is to fight back. Dont forget to vote y'all. Local elections too. Do whatever you can to give as little power as possible to hate-mongers."
